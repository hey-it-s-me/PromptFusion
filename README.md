##Abstract
The goal of infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) is to integrate the unique advantages of both modalities to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of a scene. However, existing methods struggle to effectively handle modal disparities, resulting in visual degradation of the details and prominent targets of the fused images. To address these challenges, we introduce PromptFusion, a prompt-based approach that harmoniously combines multi-modality images under the guidance of semantic prompts. Firstly, to better characterize the features of different modalities, a contourlet autoencoder is designed to separate and extract the high-/low-frequency components of different modalities, thereby improving the extraction of fine details and textures. We also introduce a prompt learning mechanism using positive and negative prompts, leveraging Vision-Language Models to improve the fusion modelâ€™s understanding and identification of targets in multi-modality images, leading to improved performance in downstream tasks. Furthermore, we employ bi-level asymptotic convergence optimization. This approach simplifies the intricate non-singleton non-convex bi-level problem into a series of convergent and differentiable single optimization problems that can be effectively resolved through gradient descent. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art, delivering superior fusion quality and boosting the performance of related downstream tasks.
